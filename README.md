## Contributing
Want to help out? Fork this repository, make your changes, and send a pull request.
Please try using a code style consistent with the rest of the project. This includes, but is not limited to:

 * For indentation, using tabs with a size of `4`
 * Always using brackets for `if` statements, and the opening bracket on the same line of the `if` statement
 * End lines with a semicolon
 * Using template literals (`\``) with strings with variables
 
Do not worry too much over styling--I will look over your code and may change some lines anyways.
